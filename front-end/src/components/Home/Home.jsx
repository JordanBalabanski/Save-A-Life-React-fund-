                The idea of "Save a life" is to help animals in need. Here you can either make a posts for an animal
                you've found and help it find a new home, or be the one giving it shelter. Every post has photos, title
                and description with information about the animal, plus contact information. Also there is a comment
                section if you can't seem to contact the user. Everything is free in the name of the animals.
